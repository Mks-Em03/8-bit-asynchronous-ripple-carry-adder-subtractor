# 8-bit-asynchronous-ripple-carry-adder-subtractor
Imagine a digital circuit that can add or subtract 8-bit binary numbers. This is the core function of an 8-bit  asynchronous ripple-carry adder/subtractor. Unlike some other adders, it operates asynchronously, meaning each  bit position calculates its result independently without waiting for previous bits,
